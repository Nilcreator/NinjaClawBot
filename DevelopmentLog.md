# Development Log

## 2026-03-10

Summary:

- refined the agentic development workflow for the new Pi 5 driver libraries
- updated the `ninjaclawbot-implementation` skill to follow the standalone-first `pi5*` migration plan
- aligned repository docs so the skill, development plan, and developer guide point to the same workflow

Files changed:

- `.agents/skills/ninjaclawbot-implementation/SKILL.md`
- `README.md`
- `DevelopmentGuide.md`
- `DevelopmentLog.md`

Why:

- the original skill was too generic for the current Pi 5 library migration work
- the new workflow needed explicit rules for required files, required functions, backend selection, quality checks, and manual Raspberry Pi 5 validation after each library

Lint and test results:

- no code tests run
- documentation-only update

Raspberry Pi validation status:

- not applicable for this change

Follow-up:

- use the updated skill as the default implementation guide for future `pi5buzzer`, `pi5servo`, `pi5disp`, and `pi5vl53l0x` work
